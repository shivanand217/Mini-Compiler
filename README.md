   # Mini-Compiler

   # Implementation of a Very Small Compiler in Js from Scratch.

   ***************       Supports All the basic features of what a Compiler should must Have:-      ******************

1. Parsing - It is the process of taking raw code and turning it into a more abstract
   representation of the code.

2. Transformation takes this abstract representation (Abstract Syntax Tree) and manipulates to do
   whatever the compiler wants it to.
    
3. Code Generation takes the transformed representation of the code and turns it into new code.
